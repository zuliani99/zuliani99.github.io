## Welcome to my personal website! 🤩 

### Here it is a litte of me... 🙄

- 🔬 I am close to graduate. My thesis is about to create a newer Active learning strategy based on Graph Transduction Game algorithm, in collaboration with professor [Sebastiano Vascon](https://www.sebastianovascon.it/) 

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available [here](https://zuliani99.github.io/portfolio/)

- 💬 I am available to discuss new ideas and if you need any help on any of my previous projects feel free to reach me!

- ⚡ Fun fact **I love Formula 1 and MotoGP, and I'm looking forward to work in one of these two area**
