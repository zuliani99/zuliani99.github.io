Assist undergraduate students with additional classes.

The tutorâ€™s activity will be articulated as follows:

* Frontal teaching that is explained both in the solution of exercises on the blackboard and in the solution of problems with the use of the computer;
* Reception of students in person and by e-mail

The resented exercises and examples (previously prepared and, if necessary, discussed with the teacher) will help for a deeper understanding of the theoretical aspects of probability calculation, practical implications and applications. It is intended to make the Probability and Statistics course more modern and attractive to students through the use of R software for some calculations and for the development of illustrative examples. The tutor will need to support students in the use of R and especially in understanding the suitable tools for solving each problem.
